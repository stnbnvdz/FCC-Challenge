          <h2>Why Use Monaca?</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>Monaca’s top 3 benefits are:</p>

          <p>
            1) Cloud-empowered Development: Our tools are designed to utilize
            the cloud to supercharge your app development in two ways. The
            complete cloud development environment gives you flexibility with no
            setup required. And the cloud-synced local development enables you
            to use your own environment but enjoy features like device live-sync
            and remote build. It’s the best of both worlds.
          </p>

          <p>
            2)Framework Agnostic: Our open source Onsen Framework is tightly
            integrated with Monaca tools. However, you can use Monaca with any
            JavaScript frameworks. We support Angular 1, 2+, React and Vue.js,
            or you can bring your own favorite framework. There are many
            templates ready to use, so you can get started immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            3) Mix-and-match as You Like: We’ve got you covered all the way from
            design, app development, backend development, testing & debugging to
            build & distribution. Monaca can be used as a whole or a piece,
            working with your favorite tools like Sublime Text or Git. Just pick
            what you need. We will seamlessly plug into your workflow.

          <h2>Monaca Cloud IDE</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Monaca Cloud IDE is a browser-based development environment. Right
            from your Web browser, all of your Cordova development can be done
            without any setup. From Cordova IDE, debugger to remote build, we’ve
            got everything you need in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monaca Cloud IDE provides a browser-based development environment as
            a service. Right from your Web browser, all of your Cordova
            development is done without any setup. Along with the Monaca
            Debugger, Live Preview (built-in function in Monaca Cloud IDE)
            allows you to easily check the progress of your apps during
            development. Noticeably, there are neither Cordova plugins nor
            native functions in Live Preview. Therefore, the app required those
            plugins and functions can’t be previewed properly.

            On top of the flexibility in the development environment, Monaca
            also provides high development efficiency by using Monaca Debugger.
            Monaca Debugger is an application used to test and debug your Monaca
            applications on real devices without building the applications
            during the development. It needs to be installed on your mobile
            devices. The app will automatically sync all your development
            projects and run them without the build process.

          <p>
            Simple and easy backend service APIs are available for Cordova Apps.
            Push notifications, user management, remote database, email delivery
            and much more. Backend Management APIs is also provided for the
            access from your backend server.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a growing need for mobile apps to have user management
            functions which allow users to register and keep their data in a
            database. Monaca Backend provides these functionalities in advance
            as a cloud-based service that can manage users without a need for
            server-side development on the client’s part.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to add Monaca Backend into your Monaca project, please do
            as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              From Monaca Cloud IDE menu, click on Backend. Then, Monaca Backend
              will be open in a new tab.<br />
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Click on Create and use the Monaca Backend button.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The following dialog will appear. You can create a new Backend, or
              select an existing one which is used in a different project. Then,
              click Apply to attach the Backend to your project.

            The apps consist of the Web and native characteristics. (See the
            picture below)
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Regardless of operating systems, hybrid apps run on a browser
            component (cross-platform support). In other words, they can run on
            iOS, Android, and other supported platforms since they run on
            WebView component of those platforms. Therefore, one source code can
            run on multiple supported platforms.
